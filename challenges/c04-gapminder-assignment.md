*Purpose*: Learning to do EDA well takes practice! In this challenge
you’ll further practice EDA by first completing a guided exploration,
then by conducting your own investigation. This challenge will also give
you a chance to use the wide variety of visual tools we’ve been
learning.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category    | Needs Improvement                                                                                                | Satisfactory                                                                                                               |

*Background*: [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/about-gapminder/) is
an independent organization that seeks to educate people about the state
of the world. They seek to counteract the worldview constructed by a
hype-driven media cycle, and promote a “fact-based worldview” by
focusing on data. The dataset we’ll study in this challenge is from
Gapminder.

# Guided EDA

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

First, we’ll go through a round of *guided EDA*. Try to pay attention to
the high-level process we’re going through—after this guided round
you’ll be responsible for doing another cycle of EDA on your own!

### **q0** Perform your “first checks” on the dataset. What variables are in this

dataset?

``` r
## TASK: Do your "first checks" here!
glimpse(gapminder)
```

    ## Rows: 1,704
    ## Columns: 6
    ## $ country   <fct> "Afghanistan", "Afghanistan", "Afghanistan", "Afghanistan", …
    ## $ continent <fct> Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, …
    ## $ year      <int> 1952, 1957, 1962, 1967, 1972, 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, 1997, …
    ## $ lifeExp   <dbl> 28.801, 30.332, 31.997, 34.020, 36.088, 38.438, 39.854, 40.8…
    ## $ pop       <int> 8425333, 9240934, 10267083, 11537966, 13079460, 14880372, 12…
    ## $ gdpPercap <dbl> 779.4453, 820.8530, 853.1007, 836.1971, 739.9811, 786.1134, …

**Observations**:

- Write all variable names here

country, continent, year, liefExp, pop, gdpPercap

### **q1** Determine the most and least recent years in the `gapminder` dataset.

*Hint*: Use the `pull()` function to get a vector out of a tibble.
(Rather than the `$` notation of base R.)

``` r
## TASK: Find the largest and smallest values of `year` in `gapminder`
year_max <- gapminder %>% pull(year) %>% max()
year_min <- gapminder %>% pull(year) %>% min()
```

Use the following test to check your work.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change this
assertthat::assert_that(year_max %% 7 == 5)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(year_max %% 3 == 0)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(year_min %% 7 == 6)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(year_min %% 3 == 2)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
if (is_tibble(year_max)) {
  print("year_max is a tibble; try using `pull()` to get a vector")
  assertthat::assert_that(False)
}

print("Nice!")
```

    ## [1] "Nice!"

### **q2** Filter on years matching `year_min`, and make a plot of the GDP per capita against continent. Choose an appropriate `geom_` to visualize the data. What observations can you make?

You may encounter difficulties in visualizing these data; if so document
your challenges and attempt to produce the most informative visual you
can.

``` r
## TASK: Create a visual of gdpPercap vs continent
gm_min <- gapminder[gapminder$year == year_min,]

gm_min %>% 
  ggplot(aes(continent, gdpPercap)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q2-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Write your observations here

When taking the mean of GDP per capita for each country in a continent,
Oceania has the biggest value.

**Difficulties & Approaches**:

- Write your challenges and your approach to solving them

There are multiple countries in each continent, therefore some kind of
sum had to be taken. In this case, a boxplot was chosen to visualize,
since it not only shows the mean values, but the distribution and
outliers.

### **q3** You should have found *at least* three outliers in q2 (but possibly many more!). Identify those outliers (figure out which countries they are).

``` r
## TASK: Identify the outliers from q2

print(gm_min %>% slice_max(gdpPercap)) 
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 6
    ##   country continent  year lifeExp    pop gdpPercap
    ##   <fct>   <fct>     <int>   <dbl>  <int>     <dbl>
    ## 1 Kuwait  Asia       1952    55.6 160000   108382.

``` r
print(gm_min[gm_min$continent == "Europe",] %>% slice_max(gdpPercap))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 6
    ##   country     continent  year lifeExp     pop gdpPercap
    ##   <fct>       <fct>     <int>   <dbl>   <int>     <dbl>
    ## 1 Switzerland Europe     1952    69.6 4815000    14734.

``` r
print(gm_min[gm_min$continent == "Americas",] %>% slice_max(gdpPercap))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 6
    ##   country       continent  year lifeExp       pop gdpPercap
    ##   <fct>         <fct>     <int>   <dbl>     <int>     <dbl>
    ## 1 United States Americas   1952    68.4 157553000    13990.

**Observations**:

- Identify the outlier countries from q2
  - (Your response here) Kuwait, Switzerland, and the United States
    stand out as the most unusual in terms of GDP per capita in each
    continent.

*Hint*: For the next task, it’s helpful to know a ggplot trick we’ll
learn in an upcoming exercise: You can use the `data` argument inside
any `geom_*` to modify the data that will be plotted *by that geom
only*. For instance, you can use this trick to filter a set of points to
label:

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit, use ideas from this in q4 below
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == max(year)) %>%

  ggplot(aes(continent, lifeExp)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(
    data = . %>% filter(country %in% c("United Kingdom", "Japan", "Zambia")),
    mapping = aes(color = country),
    size = 2
  )
```

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/layer-filter-1.png)<!-- -->

### **q4** Create a plot similar to yours from q2 studying both `year_min` and `year_max`. Find a way to highlight the outliers from q3 on your plot *in a way that lets you identify which country is which*. Compare the patterns between `year_min` and `year_max`.

*Hint*: We’ve learned a lot of different ways to show multiple
variables; think about using different aesthetics or facets.

``` r
## TASK: Create a visual of gdpPercap vs continent
gm_min %>% 
  ggplot(aes(continent, gdpPercap)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(
    data = . %>% filter(country %in% c("United States", "Kuwait", "Switzerland")),
    mapping = aes(color = country),
    size = 2
  )
```

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q4-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Write your observations here

According to the boxplot, outliers only exist above the mean for each
continent. Regardless of general tendencies, Kuwait has a
disproportionately large GDP per capita value.

# Your Own EDA

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Now it’s your turn! We just went through guided EDA considering the GDP
per capita at two time points. You can continue looking at outliers,
consider different years, repeat the exercise with `lifeExp`, consider
the relationship between variables, or something else entirely.

### **q5** Create *at least* three new figures below. With each figure, try to pose new questions about the data.

``` r
## TASK: Your first graph
gdp_out <- gapminder %>% filter(country == "Kuwait" |
                                   country == "United States" | 
                                   country == "Switzerland")


gdp_out %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap, color = country)) +
  geom_line()
```

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q5-task1-1.png)<!-- -->

- (Your notes and observations here)

The GDP per capita of Kuwait fluctuates wildly before settling into the
trend of the other outliers. A question that arises here is that how
does the GDP per capita look like for the entire world across the years
compared to these three countries?

``` r
## TASK: Your second graph
gdp_percap_mean <- aggregate(gdpPercap ~ year, gapminder, mean)
 
ggplot(gdp_percap_mean, aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap)) +
geom_line() +
geom_line(
    data = gapminder %>% filter(country %in% c("United States", "Kuwait", "Switzerland", "India", "China")),
    mapping = aes(color = country),
  )
```

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q5-task2-1.png)<!-- -->

- (Your notes and observations here)

The worldwide trend is the GDP per capita is increasing as time goes on.
I have included China and India here, the two most populated countries
in the world. As in the name, GDP per capita, is also dependent on
population, it would be interesting to see how the shape of the graphs
may change when taking the variable into consideration.

``` r
## TASK: Your third graph
gdp_country <- gapminder %>% filter(country == "Kuwait" |
                                country == "United States" | 
                                country == "Switzerland" |
                                country == "China" |
                                country == "India"
                                )

gdp_country <- gdp_country %>% mutate(gdp = gdpPercap * pop)

gdp_country %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = gdp, color = country)) +
  geom_line()
```

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q5-task3-1.png)<!-- -->

- (Your notes and observations here)

When multiplied by population, United States has the biggest GDP by a
large margin. It is also interesting to note that while China and India
had smaller GDP per capita values, even compared to the mean of the
entire world, their GDP itself is larger than that of Kuwait and
Switzerland, which both had bigger GDP per capita values than the global
mean.
